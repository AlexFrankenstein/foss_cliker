# Foss_cliker

Hi!
This is a simple python clicker simulating "Left Ctrl" click. By the way it is my first program I made and publish here.  Thank you.

In Pycharm create new project. Then in pycharm terminal type:
```python
pip install tkinter pyautogui time pyinstaller
```

Copy "cliker.py", "clicker.spec" and "icon.ico"
In terminal type:
```
pyinstaller --noconsole -F -i "C:\Users\$USER\PycharmProjects\clicker\icon.ico" cIiker.py
```

Done! Your .exe in directory "dist".
